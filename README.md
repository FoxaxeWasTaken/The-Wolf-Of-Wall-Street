# Trade

Project made by :

- [Axel Idoux](https://github.com/FoxaxeWasTaken)
- [Lucas Hauszler](https://github.com/ripel2)

for our 2nd year of engineering school at Epitech.

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a trading algorithm to trade crypto-currencies on a simulated market. (see [AI Bot Workspace](https://github.com/jmerle/ai-bot-workspace))

## How to use

### Install dependencies

```bash
git clone git@github.com:FoxaxeWasTaken/The-Wolf-Of-Wall-Street.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the project

`Use AI Bot Workspace to run the project
<br>
**or**
<br>
Test the script results with the given testing utility
```bash
tests/get_algo_results.py
```

## Our algorithm

See [Algorithm](/algorithm.md)

### Why we failed

We simply didn't work enough on the project to get the best results possible, so we focused on making a simple strategy but to do it well.
We implemented many of the required features to build a good strategy (multiple indicators, TP/SL, trailing stops), but we didn't have enough time to
test it and to improve it.
